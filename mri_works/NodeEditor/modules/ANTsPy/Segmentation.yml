ants_kmeans_segmentation:
  kmask: [[0.0]] #  (ANTsImage (optional)) – segment inside this mask
  mrf: 0.1 # (scalar) – smoothness, higher is smoother
ants_atropos:
  i: 'Kmeans[3]' # (string) – initialization usually KMeans[N] for N classes or a list of N prior probability images. See Atropos in ANTs for full set of options.
  m: '[0.2, 1x1]' # (string) – mrf parameters as a string, usually “[smoothingFactor,radius]” where smoothingFactor determines the amount of smoothing and radius determines the MRF neighborhood, as an ANTs style neighborhood vector eg “1x1x1” for a 3D image. The radius must match the dimensionality of the image, eg 1x1 for 2D and The default in ANTs is smoothingFactor=0.3 and radius=1. See Atropos for more options.
  c: '[5, 0]' # (string) – convergence parameters, “[numberOfIterations,convergenceThreshold]”. A threshold of 0 runs the full numberOfIterations, otherwise Atropos tests convergence by comparing the mean maximum posterior probability over the whole region of interest defined by the mask x.
  priorweight: 0.25 # (scalar) – usually 0 (priors used for initialization only), 0.25 or 0.5.
