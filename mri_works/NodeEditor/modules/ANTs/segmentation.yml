  image-dimensionality: '' # 2/3/4. This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If not specified, N4 tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image. 
  mask-image: '' # maskImageFilename. 
                 # If a mask image is specified, the final bias correction is only performed in the 
                 # mask region. If a weight image is not specified, only intensity values inside 
                 # the masked region are used during the execution of the algorithm. If a weight 
                 # image is specified, only the non-zero weights are used in the execution of the 
                 # algorithm although the mask region defines where bias correction is performed in 
                 # the final output. Otherwise bias correction occurs over the entire image domain.

  rescale-intensities: '' # 0/(1).
                          # At each iteration, a new intensity mapping is calculated and applied but there 
                          # is nothing which constrains the new intensity range to be within certain values. 
                          # The result is that the range can "drift" from the original at each iteration. 
                          # This option rescales to the [min,max] range of the original image intensities 
                          # within the user-specified mask. 
  weight-image: '' # weightImageFilename
                   # The weight image allows the user to perform a relative weighting of specific 
                   # voxels during the B-spline fitting. For example, some studies have shown that N3 
                   # performed on white matter segmentations improves performance. If one has a 
                   # spatial probability map of the white matter, one can use this map to weight the 
                   # b-spline fitting towards those voxels which are more probabilistically 
                   # classified as white matter. See also the option description for the mask image. 
  shrink-factor: '' # 1/2/3/4/...
                     # Running N4 on large images can be time consuming. To lessen computation time, 
                     # the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified as a single 
                     # integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factors <= 4 are commonly used. 
  convergence: '[1000x1000x1000,1.e-5]' # [<numberOfIterations=50x50x50x50>,<convergenceThreshold=0.0>]
                                        # Convergence is determined by calculating the coefficient of variation between 
                                        # subsequent iterations. When this value is less than the specified threshold from 
                                        # the previous iteration or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded the 
                                        # program terminates. Multiple resolutions can be specified by using 'x' between 
                                        # the number of iterations at each resolution, e.g. 100x50x50.

                                 # These options describe the b-spline fitting parameters. The initial b-spline 
                                 # mesh at the coarsest resolution is specified either as the number of elements in 
                                 # each dimension, e.g. 2x2x3 for 3-D images, or it can be specified as a single 
                                 # scalar parameter which describes the isotropic sizing of the mesh elements. The 
                                 # latter option is typically preferred. For each subsequent level, the spline 
                                 # distance decreases in half, or equivalently, the number of mesh elements doubles 
                                 # Cubic splines (order = 3) are typically used.
