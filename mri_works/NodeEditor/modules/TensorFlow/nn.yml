tf_nn_conv3d:
  data_format: enumerate(('NDHWC', 'NCDHW')) # An optional string from: "NDHWC", "NCDHW". Defaults to "NDHWC". The data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NDHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels]. Alternatively, the format could be "NCDHW", the data storage order is: [batch, in_channels, in_depth, in_height, in_width].
  dilations: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] # An optional list of ints. Defaults to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. 1-D tensor of length 5. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of data_format, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1. 
  name: '' # A name for the operation (optional).
